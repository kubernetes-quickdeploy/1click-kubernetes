Welcome to Kubenernetes World
Lets take a sneek peak on how we can install  1Click-Kubernetes using Ansible

We are using Ubuntu Server image 20 as master and worker nodes

We are building Kubernets cluster on basis of following compeonents
1) Ubuntu server 18/20 LTS Versios 
2) Docker as container runtime
3) Kubernetes orchestration of course :)
4) Flanneld for Networking
5) calico for network policy and management
